# Monte-Carlo Simulation

## Description
This repo contains the codebase of my assignments and projects for my Monte Carlo Simulation course.
The different modules created are - 
1) sampling : This file contains functions for sampling from Uniform and Gaussian distribution.

2) custom_sampler : This file contains a uniform random number generator implemented from scratch.

3) gaussian_paths : This file contains functions to generate : 
    1. Brownian Motion path
    2. Geometric Brownian Motion path
    3. Brownian Bridge

4) stochastic_processes : This file contains functions to generate paths for the following stochastic processes - 
    1. Ornstein - Uhlenbeck
    2. CIR
    3. Heston
    4. Variance Gamma
    5. Merton Jump
